# Flask Fundamentals Projects
### Using python in a micro-framework

#### In this section we covered how python can be used to create full-scale web applications with the help of the Flask.
#### Main concepts were:
* ##### Rendering Templates
* ##### Redirecting Routes
* ##### Form Data
* ##### GET & POST requests
* ##### Session

# Projects

* #### Number Game
  > Create a site that when a user loads it creates a random number between 1-100 and stores the number in session. Allow the user to guess at the number and tell them when they are too high or too low. If they guess the correct number tell them and offer to play again.

  >- Practice using session to store data about a client's history with the web app  
  >- Practice clearing a session  
  >- Practice having the server use data submitted by a client with a form  

* #### Ninja Gold
  > Create a simple game to test your understanding of flask, and implement the functionality below.  
  > For this assignment, you're going to create a mini-game that helps a ninja make some money!  
  > When you start the game, your ninja should have 0 gold. The ninja can go to different places (farm, cave, house, casino)   
  > and earn different amounts of gold. In the case of a casino, your ninja can earn or LOSE up to 50 golds.   
  > Your job is to create a web app that allows this ninja to earn gold and to display past activities of this ninja.  

  >- Practice using session
  >- Practice having the server use data sent by the client in a form
  >- Practice using hidden inputs
